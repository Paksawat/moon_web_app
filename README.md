# moon_web_app
https://mfdproject-12381.web.app/
 * should be used on mobile size

1. semester project in my Web Development PBA. Criteria was a web applications made in vue, using web APIs. 
This app is not maintained and due to the heavy use of different APIs, it has lost alot of it functions. 

The idea: A informative PWA about the moon and it's cycles. Having access to news about space and being able to see different moon events. Later incorporating a quiz where you could collect badges. 
This was mostly meant for school kids. 

This functions that was in place on launch: 
 - Current data of the moon today
 - Location based
 - upcoming events and countdown
 - shortcut searching and create own toolbar from shortcuts
 - news about space
 - Login function working with email/password, google or faceboook
 - Bases for a PWA

Created Vue with Firebase and Firestore as backend.

Other than develop the frontend, i also did the design og the app.
